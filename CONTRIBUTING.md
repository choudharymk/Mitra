# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Mitra for Developers] provides you functionality of matematical Matrix in python,
  * Exception? [Restrictions] It can perform complex number Matrix operation
  * PYTHON [3]: It is only for python3 user

## Testing

Mitra is not tested by any testing toolkit

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to rdsquare](on mail: rdsquare144@gmail.com) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include linear differential equation, eigenvalue or eigenvector by Matrix.Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We use comments at necessary place
  * We choose function name carefully that make some sense to user
  * We avoid logic in views, putting HTML generators into helpers
  * We avoid use of images, video, audio or any graphic item. And also avoid user interface for Matrix (assuming: It will be done by user itself)
Thanks,
